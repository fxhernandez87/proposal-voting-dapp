### Proposal Voting DApp

DApp that allows people to vote on a (binary) proposal. 

Each ethereum address should be allowed to vote only once and the vote should cost 0.01 ETH.

- When a user opens the page, it should see the result so far (number of positive votes vs. number of negative votes).
- If an account hasn't voted yet, they should also see two buttons: one for voting "Yes" and one for "No". If they already voted, they should see their vote instead. 
- Votes cannot be updated.
- Results should be updated in real-time: if someone else votes when I have the page open, I should see the new result.
